__About me__

I was born in Voronezh, later moved to Moscow, graduated from school there and the College of Computer Science and Programming at the Financial University. I love listening to music, I'm into hiking and board games. I started coding in the last years of my studies at school. I carried out orders from friends, did internships and internships in little-known and private companies. I am currently passing through additional courses and developing web development skills and programming, I am simultaneously engaged in job search and admission to the Armenian University.

At this stage of my life, I am on a free float strengthening my skills both personal and related to programming ðŸ§™
